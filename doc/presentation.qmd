### 01_load:

Data has been loaded and saved in a tsv-file.

### 02_clean:

Global syntax of NA, and Y/N for binary variables, global syntax for the use of numbers 1-8 as to describe causes of death, correction of errors made when the data was gathered, removal of column determined to be irrelevant, and lastly merging of columns for easier data analysis.
