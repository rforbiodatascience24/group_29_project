## Introduction

### The International Stroke Trial v. 2 data

-   Assessing efficacy and safety of antithrombotic therapy compared to control.
-   Antithrombotic agents: Aspirin and subcutaneous Heparin.

### Stroke and treatments

-   Stroke is a loss of blood to the brain
-   All death causes in the data are due to possibly related blood problems

### Project Aim

-   Assessing effects of antithrombotics for stroke
-   Antiplatelet treatment: Aspirin
-   Anticoagulent treatment: Heparin
-   There were no conclusive studies at this time to whether this type of treatments would work

## Methods

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Raw data:
-   19435 observations with 112 variables.

### 01_load:
-   Data has been loaded and saved in a tsv-file.

### 02_clean:
-   Global syntax of NA, and Y/N for binary variables.
-   Global syntax for the use of numbers 1-8 as to describe causes of death.
-   Correction of errors made when the data was collected.
-   Removal of column determined to be irrelevant.
-   Merging of columns for easier data analysis.
-   Data was split and re-joined into one.

::: {.column width="50%"}
### 03_augment

-   Groups created based on different treatments, and different doses of aspirin and heparin.
```{.r}
# 03_augment.qmd
# Adding the different treatment groups 
data_clean_trtgroups <- data_clean_hepgroups |> 
  mutate("data_group" = case_when(
    (RXASP == "Y" & RXHEP == "L") ~ "Asp-Hep(low)",
    (RXASP == "Y" & RXHEP == "M") ~ "Asp-Hep(med)",
    (RXASP == "Y" & RXHEP == "N") ~ "Asp-Hep(No)",
    (RXASP == "N" & RXHEP == "L") ~ "Asp(No)-Hep(low)",
    (RXASP == "N" & RXHEP == "M") ~ "Asp(No)-Hep(med)",
    (RXASP == "N" & RXHEP == "N") ~ "Asp(No)-Hep(No)"
  ))

## Descriptive analysis

:::: {.columns}

```{r}
#| message: false

data_augmented <- read_tsv(file = here('data/03_dat_aug.tsv'))
dimensions <- dim(data_augmented)
obs <- nrow(data_augmented)
vari <- ncol(data_augmented)
treat_groups <- data_augmented |> distinct(data_group) |> nrow()
```

- **Observations/patients**: `r obs`
- **Variables**: `r vari`
- **Treatment groups**: `r treat_groups`

## Time of death after randomization up till 6 months

-   Most of the patients that die, die within the first 20 days after randomization
-   The treatment impact must therefore happen within the first period of time

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results/07_keyplot_3a.png"))
```

## Time of death after 20 days

## Events during first 14 days are indicative of treatment side effects

:::: {.columns}

```
:::
::::
-   Apparent relief of one cause of death has the opposite effect on another cause of death
-   Medication seems to cause fatal side effects
-   All effect sizes are relatively low

## Impact of treatment on subgroups

## Kaplan Meier survival curve after stroke: 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results/09_keyplot_5aa.png"))
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results/09_keyplot_5ab.png"))
```
:::
::::
-   Aspirin-Heparin(Low) treatment is the treatment with the overall highest survival rate
-   All treatments with Heparin(medium) has the lowest survival rates
-   Applying confidence intervals shows that none of the treatments are noticably away from the control treatments

## Chi squared test of the treatment effect

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results/09_keyplot_5b.png"))
```

## Discussion {.smaller}

-   There are many conflicting data collected (e.g. date of death = 20 days, but not dead)
-   The study is very biased for Age, effect for Age should be removed
-   This study found the same as the original study, but not with an as strong effect

### Conclusion
-   Aspirin has an overall very low positive effect on the patient survival
-   Herparin (Medium Dose) has an overall low negative on the patient survival
-   Based on this study, no treatment should be given
