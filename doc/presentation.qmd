## Introduction

### The International Stroke Trial v. 2 data

-   Assessing efficacy and safety of antithrombotic therapy compared to control.
-   Antithrombotic agents: Aspirin and subcutaneous Heparin.

### Ischaemic stroke and treatments

-   **Ischaemic stroke**: Medical condition in which poor blood flow to a part of the brain causes cell death

### Project Aim

-   Assessing effects of antithrombotics (heparin and aspirin) for recurrent ischaemic strokes

## Methods

### Raw data:

-   19435 observations with 112 variables.

### 01_load:

-   Data has been loaded and saved in a tsv-file.

### 02_clean:

-   Global syntax of NA, and Y/N for binary variables.
-   Global syntax for the use of numbers 1-8 as to describe causes of death.
-   Correction of errors made when the data was collected.
-   Removal of column determined to be irrelevant.
-   Merging of columns for easier data analysis.
-   Data was split and re-joined into one.

### 03_augment

-   Groups created based on different treatments, and different doses of aspirin and heparin.

- Patients receiving higher heparin doses and asprin are more frequent in cerebral bleed/haemorrhagic stroke group
- Likewise, higher heparin doses and aspirin patients are more represented in patients with indicator of non-cerebral bleed
- Patient group receiving no trial medication had more subjects with indicator of pulmonary embolism
