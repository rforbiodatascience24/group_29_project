## Data analysis - Pulmonary Embolism

Creation of figure 5.D. It illustrates how pulmonary embolism after 14 days is related to 6 combinations of doses of heparin and aspirin.

In the report it looks like this:

## Loading Libraries

```{r}
#| eval: true
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Loading Data

```{r}
data <- read_tsv("../data/03_dat_aug.tsv")
```

## Finding Relevant Data

In order to make the correct plot, it is necessary to use the same variables as the authors of the article. In order to validate that the correct variables have been identified a table summing the number of patients in each group is made:

```{r}
data |> 
  group_by(RXASP,RXHEP,PE14) |> 
  count()
```

The numbers here seems to fit the numbers from figure 5.D to the extent that it can be read.

## Data Augmentation

In order to make the data set smaller and more clearly arranged, all other columns than the three relevant, are removed:

```{r}
relevant_data <- data |> 
  select(RXHEP, RXASP, PE14) 
```

The plot has percentages of reported pulmonary embolism on the y-axis. Such a variable is created.

```{r}
percentage_data <- relevant_data |>
  #Counts the patients in each group
  group_by(RXHEP, RXASP, PE14) |> 
  count() |> 
  #Creates the six groups examined
  group_by(RXHEP, RXASP) |> 
  #Creates a row with percentages for use in plot
  mutate(total_in_group = sum(n),
         percentage = n / total_in_group * 100,
         p = n / total_in_group,
         se = sqrt(p * (1 - p) / total_in_group) * 100) |> 
  #Removes all patients with no reported pulmonary embolism
  filter(PE14 != "N") 
```

To get the same order of the columns in the plot, the factors are applied to the data:

```{r}
sorted_data <- percentage_data |> 
  mutate(RXHEP = factor(RXHEP, levels = c("M", "L", "N")),
         RXASP = factor(RXASP, levels = c("Y", "N")))
```

## Visualisation

NEEDS DESCRIPTIONS ON EACH LINE

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN: "For each bar, lower part gives number and percentage of fatal events."

```{r}
sorted_data |>   
  ggplot(aes(x = RXHEP,
             y = percentage,
             fill = RXASP,
             ymin = percentage - se,
             ymax = percentage + se)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single"),
           alpha = 0.7,
           color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(percentage, 2)),
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
            vjust = -0.5,
            size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
                width = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of patients with pulmonary embolism after 14 days",
       subtitle = "These numbers are from second consultation 14 days after randomisation",
       x = NULL,
       y = "%",
       fill = "Aspirin Dosing") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2",
                    labels = c("Y" = "300 mg daily",
                                 "N" = "No Aspirin")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("M" = "12500 IU Heparin",
                              "L" = "5000 IU Heparin",
                              "N" = "No Heparin"))
```
