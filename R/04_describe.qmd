## Boxplot for predicted probability of death at 6 months compared by gender 

```{r}


# Boxplot of predicted probability of death at 6 months distributed by gender 
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = SEX, y = EXPDD,fill=SEX)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7,color="black") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkred", "blue")) + # Custom fill colors for gender
  labs(
    title = "Predicted probability of death at 6 months",
    x = "Gender",
    y = " EXPD6",
    fill = "Gender",
    color = "Gender"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 18),
    axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    legend.position = "top"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 1), # Adjust the range to display outliers
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0.05, 0.1)) # Add some space for outliers
  )
```

```{r}

#Calculate median EXPDD by gender

median_table <- dataset |> 
  group_by(SEX) |> 
  summarize(Median_EXPDD = median(EXPDD, na.rm = TRUE))
print(median_table)
```

From the medians of the EXPDD variable, it can be seen by comparing the genders, that females have a higher median of 0.73175 than males (0.53940), thus a relatively higher predicted probability of death at 6 months from randomization.

Table 1 - characteristics of patients

Table 2 - outcome of the different groups after 14 days

Table 3 - outcome of the different groups after 6 months

Table 4 - outcome of the different groups after 14 days split up into groups with and without atrial fibrillation

Table 5 - outcome of the different groups after 14 days of only heparin split between small and medium dose

Table 6 - Direct comparison of low dose heparin and aspirin absolute outcomes after 14 days compared to the control
